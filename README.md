This is my personal implementation of some of the most popular algorithms and datastructures, as thought in the Cambridge Computer Science Algorithms Course Part 1A.

The main purpose of these implementations is to increase my understanding of how they work and the different trade-offs each of the algorithm or datastructure brings along.
